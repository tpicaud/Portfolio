    about: `I am currently a student in software engineering, in my fifth and final year at ESIR, a French school based in Rennes.
      I have studied a wide range of domains during my academic journey, including software modeling, cryptography, language theory, 
      and full-stack web development. As a result, I have worked with technologies such as Java, C++, Python, Rust, as well as React,  
      Angular, NestJS, Electron, and PostgreSQL.
      In parallel, I delved into blockchain on my own, which has allowed me to acquire a strong understanding of the underlying technologies 
      and the ecosystem. My goal is to continue learning new things, especially in the blockchain field, as I am convinced it has a 
      great future ahead that I want to be a part of
